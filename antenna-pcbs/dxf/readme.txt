These DXF files are intended for people who want to make their own PCBs (e.g. using a CNC machine) and are unable to process Gerber files. Unlike the Gerber files, these files are incomplete descriptions of the PCBs. It requires quite some manual work to turn this into a functional PCB. Only use these if you have no other choice.

The PCB material *must* be 1.0mm FR4. If you use the wrong thickness, the antenna will not perform properly.

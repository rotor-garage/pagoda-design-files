There are multiple versions of the Pagoda-2 antenna:
"2"  = default version, optimized for use without any protective shell
"2B" = optimized for use with a 1.0 mm ABS shell (for MenaceRC)

For those who are unfamiliar with ordering PCBs, you should send the zip file corresponding to each PCB to the manufacturer.

For example, if you want version "2" LHCP, you would send the following three files:
- pcb_pagoda_2_part1_lhcp.zip
- pcb_pagoda_2_part2_lhcp.zip
- pcb_pagoda_2_part3.zip

You should place a separate order for each part, unless you are producing large quantities and you want to panelize them, in which case you probably don't need this explanation :).

Example order configuration for Elecrow:
- Layers: "2"
- PCB Thickness: "1.6mm"
- Copper Weight: "1oz 35um"
- PCB Size: "5cm Max * 5cm Max"
- PCB Color: "Red" (or anything else, it really doesn't matter)
- Surface Finish: "Hasl" (or "Hasl (lead free)" if you use lead-free solder)
- PCB Stencil: "No Stencil"
- Lead time: your choice
- Panelizing: "Single PCB with milling"
- File: "pcb_pagoda_2_part1_lhcp.zip"

These PDF files are intended for people who want to etch their own PCBs and are unable to process Gerber files. Unlike the Gerber files, these files are incomplete descriptions of the PCBs. It requires quite some manual work to turn this into a functional PCB. Only use these if you have no other choice.

The SVG files are identical to the PDFs, but can be edited more easily, for example with Inkscape.

The PCB material *must* be 1.0mm FR4. If you use the wrong thickness, the antenna will not perform properly.

These files should allow you to 3D print the assembly jig if you prefer this over lasercutting. I still recommend lasercutting if you have the option, because MDF won't melt from the heat of soldering and it's probably a bit more accurate. Laser cutters are less common than 3D printers though, and much more expensive.

The STL files were created by David Lewis (FarVew.com).
